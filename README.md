# Mission-Demolition-Prototype
The Mission Demolition Prototype was created from the book "Unity and C#. Gamedev from idea to implementation" [Jeremy Gibson].
This prototype covers the following topics: physics, collisions, mouse interactions, game levels.
In this game, the player shoots at the castles with a slingshot, trying to destroy them. Each castle has an area, that the player must enter in order to progress to the next level.
